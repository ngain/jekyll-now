Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)
[The Lally School of Management and Technology](https://lallyschool.rpi.edu/)

I have worked in teams to deliver marketing strategy presentations to clients using digital marketing analysis (e.g. [inbound](http://seopressor.com/blog/inbound-vs-outbound-marketing-more-effective/), [AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/home/)), to create information system designs, and to write a 50-page industry company profile report.

I have gained leadership experience acting for multiple school clubs, such as [RPI Asian Cultural Union](http://aaw.union.rpi.edu/). 

### More Information

I enjoy languages, tennis and swimming, and reading news articles. I hope to pursue skiing as a hobby in the future, weather permitting..
