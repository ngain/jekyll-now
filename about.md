I am studying to receive a Bachelor's of Science (B.S.) in Business Management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Under [The Lally School of Management and Technology](https://lallyschool.rpi.edu/), I study marketing and information systems among several other fields in business. 

I have worked in teams for marketing plans and digital marketing analysis (e.g. SEO, AdWords), system analysis, and business strategy/business plan projects.

I have acted as a leader in multiple school clubs and will continue to do so in the future. I am usually involved with my school's cultural clubs, relating to language, food, and sports events.

### More Information

As hobbies, I enjoy learning languages, playing tennis and swimming, and reading news articles. I hope to puruse skiing as a hobby in the future.
