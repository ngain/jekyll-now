when I was a young, I learned from my sibling that if you angered him, you would get hurt, Bad. but being quiet meant you had nothing to say because you lost, and had no great thought to fight back with and explain yourself. 

as I Hot older, I learned that I could speak back, and get punished at times but also be successful in getting the other person to hurt, and know, and slow. 

I learned from my parents that yelping and telling would keep you alive, more so than being quiet ever would. being dead in the eyes is painful, almost as painful as being dead for real, if it's possible to equate the two (the brain is a powerful thing, a horrifying thing). 

lately I Feel that knowing 1 thing leads others to show off, and deepen what's in the Know. Failure to follow is a failure ever to have understood, especially In The Eyes once they know you did not see as far. does it matter? if it's all you believe will lead you to happiness, then it does. 

so do not care. 
do not speak. 
do not hear,
...
listen if you may want to chat, 

but do not truly hear. hearing hearts makes you susceptible, weak. 

and vulnerable, and malleable, and able to grow. 

do you want to grow? 
or die? 

hear ME now, and it just might Hello you to survive.
