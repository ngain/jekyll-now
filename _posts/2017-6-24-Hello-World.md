title: The First Step
---
For the past few days, I've explored the basics of UNIX, Git and GitHub, and Jekyll to take the first step in understanding different tools that may be used to deploy a basic website. 

As I continue to learn about GitHub Pages and existing repositories for publishing blog posts and the like, I may return to write more of these. I may even consider trying to transfer contents of my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-ngai-b4273210a) manually to this website.
