this year has been a better one

a stranger left

took a raft through between two signs that pointed to the left and pointed to the right with the word "danger" written above some other words
before realizing that the *danger* was avoided by moving to those sides

we made out alright

and here i am

figuring out what the road
of computers and screens and code and break room teevee screens 
really means
