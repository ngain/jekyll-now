this year has been a better one

a stranger left

took a raft between two signs that pointed to the left and right, with the word "danger" written above some smaller words,
before realizing that the *danger* was avoided by moving in those directions

... we made out alright

and here i am

figuring out what the road
of computers and screens and code and break room teevee reheated food and coffee and tea 
really means to me
