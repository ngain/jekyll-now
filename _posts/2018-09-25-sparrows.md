this year was a better one

a stranger left

rode a raft between two signs that pointed to the left and right, with the word "danger" written above 
before realizing that the *danger* was in the middle

... things are alright

and here i am

seeing what a road
of computers and screens and code and break room teevee re-heated food and coffee and tea 
really means to me

It's comforting, which is more than most can ask for.
