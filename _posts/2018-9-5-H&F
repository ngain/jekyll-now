### Chapter 1: The beginning where it all started

"A dim light.... falling from above... is it..... life?!?" Well, before we go any further, I should probably tell you what happened before this present point.

It all started out long, long ago. Pencil had released Fudge from his cup that was his version of jail. They both had a sense of adventure in them, both being banished from their homes.

Pencil was banished for being too short compared to the other, large, strong pencils, and wished to be able to explore the outside world, dangerous and risky. 

But Fudge mainly just wanted to be free of his cup. It was too _**small**_ and _**dark**_ for him and was plain _**torture**_ to him. So they teamed up to find new land, just like Columbus. They faced a big, sucin monster that chopped everything it faced (a lawn mower), a sharp-beaked woodpecker, the playground of giants (_**US**_ humans, playing), yet were sadly separated by a gust of wind and a large eagle. It pulled them away forever, until Pencil and Fudge 2 (_haa-haa!_). 

Fudge had returned after a long journey during the wind, and proved himself to have more endurance, and confidence within. He and Pencil reunited as detectives. They were investigating a home to a rich man: Arnold Pineda! He was presumed to be a _drug dealer._

For some reason, his [Arnold Pineda's] home had a jungle background, and looked extremely like a hobo's home to be honest. They met him, but not for long - He had turned native, swinging from vine to vine. _He died swinging from vine to vine._

He died that moment becuse he "accidentally" cut his vine at the sight of them. He fell through a window into his pit of spikes - they were made of tough steel, so it easily pierced his body and _**killed**_ him. Soon Pencil and Fudge realized that the drug dealers were going to have a meeting there, and accused Pencil and Fudge of killing Arnold. 

So they were locked in mortal combat, firecely resisting the drug dealer's blows [In the Real Pencil and Fudge 2, the battle was on a pirate ship]. Again, Pencil was soon defeated from running out of lead to fight with, and Fudge was sliced to nothingness. (Until now....)

Pencil clawed the air, gasping for breath
