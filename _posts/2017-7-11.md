title: The Experience of a Spatial Audio Performance (EMPAC, July 10th)
---
### A Bit on Focus

It is important that we, as a people, have the ability to shift focus between a variety of things: between an object on the left and an object on the right, between concrete and abstract, between present and past, and even between what is and what _could be._ 
It becomes a useful skill to have the control of mind to consciously transition between the two, for it enables artists and architects to sketch, dancers and choreographers to spatially design, and programmers just to look at pseudocode and **know** what they'll be syntactically creating moments later.
And it's useful for writing _**reviews**_ of experiences that attacked the senses a day before.

## Comment on EMPAC

[The Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center](http://empac.rpi.edu/) is a place that separates itself from the rest of [Rensselaer](http://rpi.edu/). Unlike the [materials science/engineering centers](http://manufacturing.eng.rpi.edu/MILL) and [biomedial research center](http://biotech.rpi.edu/), EMPAC serves as a place for world-class musicians to flourish, and for developing students of music to perform. For me, EMPAC is one of the last few places where creative arts at RPI has a place to shine, albeit an expensive one compared to the more independent [Ground Zero Basement](https://www.facebook.com/GZBasement/) that held numerous student-run performance nights for new, exploring, or just curious students. With a giant egg at its core and some smaller but considerable performance theaters supporting, EMPAC allows for audio engineering technology to meet with artists to create many wonders.
