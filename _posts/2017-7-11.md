title: The Experience of a Spatial Audio Performance (EMPAC, July 10th)
---

It is important that we, as a people, have the ability to shift focus between a variety of things: between an object on the left and an object on the right, between concrete and abstract, between present and past, and even between what is and what _could be._ 
It becomes a useful skill to have the control of mind to consciously transition between the two, for it enables artists and architects to sketch, dancers and choreographers to spatially design, and programmers just to look at pseudocode and **know** what they'll be syntactically creating moments later.
And it's useful for writing _**reviews**_ of experiences that attacked the senses a day before.
