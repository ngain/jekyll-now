## The Line 
![Pacific Rim's Mako Mori portrayed by Rinko Kikuchi](/images/pacificHighlights.jpg "Not the first time highlights were selected for Asian actresses for Hollywood blockbusters.")

I want to get as close to the line as possible
Without falling over and becoming viewed as a full blown-
It may seem hypocritical, but the
complexity of history concerning governments and their nations, their people, is much more intertwined
for me to believe simply that all are just, equal, and same.
I see the U.S. lack of representation of Asian-Americans
save for [highlight-donning love interests] who are both appealing for audience members 
and keeping up specific standards of who [heroes are and what beauty and handsomeness mean]
NOT being Asian males
unless you need a computer accounting math programming technology wiz at the fore.

It creates dissonance to see that media can bend so cleanly 
to write up [scathing articles for whatever could be linked to the present perceived danger,] or the clear and present danger as some would have it.

Right or wrong, just or not, [comics] [news television presidential speeches] prepared [by world-class masters of rhetoric]
are quick to [burn Russians in The Cold War]
tarnish [Vietnamese]
[Middle Easterners]
[Chinese] (and others)
and are so slow to account for shortcomings
even in [home-grown school shootings]
except when it can lead to gun safety/control, or can be blamed on race religion political affiliation extremism, or can further a money-making war-profiteering agenda
where NONE of the capital gains go to military veterans serving **_THE Capital_** and its head.
This explains why [officers] swear by the **constitution**
and the commissioned swear for The President.
